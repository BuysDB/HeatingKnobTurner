# Heating knob turner

I live in an apartment  where I have no thermostat to regulate the temperature.
The temperature is regulated by manually adjusting the heat by turning the knob of a heater. This process can be automated by having a device which turns the knob of the heater when the room becomes too warm or too cold.
I know devices like this exist commercially but thought it would be fun to build one myself. I use it to keep my house at a steady temperature and
turn the heat up and down automatically at night and in the morning.

## Features:
Knob turner with serial interface.
